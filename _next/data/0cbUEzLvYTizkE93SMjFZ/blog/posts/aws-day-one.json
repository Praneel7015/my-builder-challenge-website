The first step was to set up an AWS Free Tier account and go through the initial security and billing precautions. The article made it sound like a 30-minute task, but in reality it took me much longer. There are many small steps, and each requires verifications, so it's not exactly quick.</p>\n<p>The guide itself was thorough, which helped. For someone new, it explains every click, so I didn't feel lost. What stood out was the emphasis on security. Setting up multi-factor authentication for the root account felt like a necessary reminder, too many people skip it otherwise.</p>\n<p>Creating an IAM user instead of working directly with the root account also made sense. I've seen cases where people accidentally cause problems by using root for everything, so I appreciated that the challenge included this early.</p>\n<p>There were some inconveniences. I needed to show more ID Proof, Payment verification only worked with credit or debit cards. As a college student, these felt unnecessary, especially when local payment options like UPI or netbanking would have been simpler and are supported by others.</p>\n<p>By the end of this step, I had my AWS account with MFA enabled, a separate IAM admin user for daily work, and a budget cap of $5 with alerts. The in-detail guide (credits to <a href=\"https://builder.aws.com/community/@ana\">Ana</a> for the wonderful guide ) made sure I didnâ€™t miss anything, even if the process dragged longer than i wouldve liked.</p>\n<p>Overall it was a Great Article and Can't wait for more!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n","title":"Day 1 of AWS Builder Challenge #2, \"Secure Foundation-Setting Up Your AWS Free Tier Account\" ","date":"2025-08-16"}},"__N_SSG":true}
