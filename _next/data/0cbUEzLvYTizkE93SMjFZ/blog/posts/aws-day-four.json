I liked the example they used of data traveling between Tokyo and Mexico City,it made the concept of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) much easier to visualize.</p>\n<p>The guide walked through setting up CloudFront to distribute website content worldwide. The steps were very clear and straightforward: creating the distribution, connecting it to my S3 bucket, and configuring the root object to serve index.html. Everything worked as expected without any complications.</p>\n<p>Once deployed, I tested my global URL, and the site loaded properly: <a href=\"https://db28xe55djgls.cloudfront.net\">db28xe55djgls.cloudfront.net</a>. Direct access to the S3 bucket we created in <a href=\"/blog/posts/aws-day-two\">Day 2</a> still returned <code>Access Denied</code>, which confirmed the security setup was correct.</p>\n<p>Overall, this was a smooth process. CloudFront handled the global delivery setup, and the integration with S3 remained secure without any extra work.</p>\n<h3>Checklist for today</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[x] Created global distribution</li>\n<li>[x] Connected it securely to private storage</li>\n<li>[x] Verified website loads through CloudFront</li>\n<li>[x] Confirmed S3 bucket remains private</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://builder.aws.com/community/@ana\">Ana</a> for another solid guide, and thanks for reading!</p>\n","title":"Day 4 of the AWS Builder Challenge #2,\"Global Distribution-Making Your Website Accessible Worldwide\" ","date":"2025-08-20"}},"__N_SSG":true}
