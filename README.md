## How to Deploy to AWS S3 + CloudFront or Amplify

### AWS S3 + CloudFront
1. **Upload to S3**
   - Create an S3 bucket (e.g., `my-nextjs-site`).
   - Upload all files and folders from `/out` to your bucket.

2. **Enable Static Website Hosting**
   - In S3 bucket properties, enable "Static website hosting".
   - Set `index.html` as the index document.
   - Set `404.html` as the error document (if present).

3. **Set Up CloudFront**
   - Create a CloudFront distribution.
   - Set the origin to your S3 bucket's website endpoint.
   - Set default root object to `index.html`.
   - (Optional) Configure custom error responses for SPA routing.
     
### AWS Amplify
 You will  first connect your GitHub repository to Amplify so that every time you make changes to your code, your website automatically updates. This creates a professional deployment pipeline where GitHub stores your code and Amplify handles the website hosting and global distribution.

  1. Navigate to Amplify - In AWS Console, search for "Amplify" and click on it
  2. Create new app - Click "Deploy an app"
  3. Choose source code provider - Select "GitHub" and click "Next"
  4. Authorize GitHub - Click "Authorize AWS Amplify" and sign in to GitHub if prompted
  5. Update GitHub permissions - Click "Update GitHub permissions". You'll be redirected to GitHub to configure AWS Amplify on your GitHub account:
        Choose "Only select repositories"
        Select your `my-builder-challenge-website` repository
        Click "Install & Authorize"
  6. Select repository: (You might have to reload the page on your browser for the authorized GitHub repos to appear on Amplify)
        Choose your `my-builder-challenge-website` repository from the list
        Branch: `main` (default)
        Click "Next"

Configure app settings

  1. App name - Enter `my-builder-challenge-website`
  2. Build settings - Amplify auto-detects this is a static site, no need to change anything here, just click on "Next"
  3. Review and deploy - Click "Save and deploy"

Amplify will now automatically set up your entire infrastructure: it creates a CloudFront distribution for global delivery, processes your files (which happens instantly for static HTML sites), pushes everything to the worldwide CDN, and tests that the deployment works correctly. This whole process takes about 2-3 minutes.
Verify initial deployment

  - Get your URL - Copy the Amplify domain (like https://main.ddrcpyox7wwsr.amplifyapp.com/)
 - Test website - Your site should load with automatic HTTPS

You'll know you're done when your website loads from the Amplify URL and looks exactly like your CloudFront version.

## Notes

- This export is **static only**. No API routes or server-side rendering.
- All assets (CSS, JS, images) are included and referenced correctly for S3 hosting.
- For pretty URLs (e.g., `/about`), S3 and CloudFront will serve the corresponding `.html` file (e.g., `/about.html`).

## Regenerating This Folder

If you make changes to the site, re-run:

```bash
npm run build
```

to update the `/out` folder.
